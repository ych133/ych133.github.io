I am an Associate Professor in Computer Science and Engineering at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. Before that, I was a Principal Researcher at Microsoft Research Redmond. I got my Ph.D. from Northwestern University in 2015 and my B.S. degree from Tsinghua University in 2010. My research interests specialize in model compression & efficiency, deep generative models, and large multimodality models. From 2021 to 2023, I led several teams to productize these techniques for Microsoft-OpenAI core models (Copilot, DALL-E-2, ChatGPT, GPT-4). 

I serve as a Senior Area Chair for NeurIPS and ICML and as an Area Chair for CVPR, ICLR, ACL, NAACL, and EMNLP. I also serve as the Action Editor for Transactions on Machine Learning Research (TMLR) and ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology (TIST). My papers have won IEEE 2024 SPS Young Author Best Paper Award, Outstanding Paper Award in NeurIPS 2023, and Best Student Paper Honorable Mention in WACV 2021. I am an affiliate professor/faculty at Tsinghua University, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Fudan University, Zhejiang University, and University of Science and Technology of China.
