I am a Visiting Professor at Rice University/Renmin University of China. Before that, I was a Principal Researcher at Microsoft Research Redmond. From 2015-2018, I was a Research Staff Member at IBM Research & MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab. I got a Ph.D. from Northwestern University in 2015 and a bachelorâ€™s degree from Tsinghua University in 2010. My research covers deep learning in general, with specific interests in model compression and efficiency, deep generative models, and vision+language pertaining. I have led several teams and productized these techniques for Microsoft-OpenAI core products (e.g., Github Copilot, DALL-E-2, ChatGPT, GPT-4). I serve (or have served) as a senior area chair for NeurIPS, ICML, AAAI, and area chair for CVPR, ICLR, IJCAI, ACMMM, and NAACL.
